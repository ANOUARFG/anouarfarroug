## 🔬 Projects (with code & pipelines)

- **🔄 Real-Time Data Pipeline**  
  Weather API → Kafka → Spark Streaming → Cassandra → Metabase + Airflow  
  → Reproducible with Docker + CI/CD

- **🛡️ Intrusion Detection System**  
  MLP classifier + data drift detection (KL divergence)  
  → Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana; API with FastAPI

- **📩 Spam Detection with BERT**  
  FastAPI + React app with PostgreSQL backend  
  → Accuracy > 99%, cross-validation + deployment with Docker Compose

- **☁️ Cloud-Native DevOps Infra (WIP)**  
  Terraform + Ansible to provision K3s cluster  
  → Jenkins + GitHub Actions + monitoring + security (Trivy, Sealed Secrets)
